A structured experiment of test-driven development
-they passed 18% more functional black-box test cases. However, the TDD programmers took 16% more time.
-Shortcomings!!!

-Our results suggest that skilled developers are able to quickly learn the UTDD

-Proceedings
- the effect of TDD on program design was not as evident as expected, but the test coverage was significantly superior to iterative test-last development.
-Classification of TDD studies!!

- This paper discusses an experiment carried out within a Spanish software company with the aim of comparing productivity in TDD and TAC.

-We found that test-first students on average wrote more tests and, in turn, students who wrote more tests tended to be more productive.
-Why did more testing by Test-First subjects not result in a
proportional increase in quality?

-“test cases created by test-first developers were as good as (or as bad as) test cases created by test-last developers”. 
-test-first developers had, on average, 27% less failing assertions
